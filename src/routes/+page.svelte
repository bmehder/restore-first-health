    <h2>A Unique Treatment Solution</h2>
    <p>
      Restore First Health offers a proven, advanced therapy for the treatment of chronic
      wounds. We utilize FDA approved skin substitutes in conjunction with high quality
      wound care. We help patients who suffer from wounds that show no significant
      progress toward healing after 30 days documented of conventional treatment.
    </p>
    <p>
      Our clinical team evaluates, measures, and examines the wounds for infections. Once
      deemed qualified, our team visits the patients in their home once a week, addresses
      the wound and places a specialized skin substitute. Patients normally begin to
      experience healing within the first few applications!

      From the first phone call or referral to our initial at home evaluation and therapy,
      we inform, communicate and ensure all of our patients and their care providers are
      on the same page at all times.
